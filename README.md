# Independent-Housing-Research-Project

Through my [Kreisman Housing Fellowship](https://kreismaninitiative.uchicago.edu/fellows-program/) and during my internship at the [Chicago Community Trust](https://www.cct.org/), I conducted independent research and
analysis on the City of Chicago [Connected Communities Ordinance](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/equitable-transit-oriented-development/home/connected-communities-ordinance.html) using manually collected housing data from [zillow](https://www.zillow.com/).
This analysis culmiated in a powerpoint presentation to CCT and it's partners on the potential impacts (or lack of impact) the ordinance has on home sale activity.
